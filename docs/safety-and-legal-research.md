# ⚠️ Safety & Legal Research

Outstanding questions and research needed for Black Bart's Gold.

## 🔴 CRITICAL RESEARCH NEEDED

These items require external research before finalizing:

---

## 🚫 Banned Zones

### Current Status: UNCERTAIN

| Zone Type | Current Decision | Research Needed |
|-----------|------------------|-----------------|
| Water (oceans, lakes, rivers) | ❌ BANNED | None - decided |
| Private Property | ✅ ALLOWED | Is this legally ok? |
| Schools | ❓ UNKNOWN | Legal implications? |
| Hospitals | ❓ UNKNOWN | Safety concerns? |
| Cemeteries | ❓ UNKNOWN | Typically public, but appropriate? |
| Government Buildings | ❓ UNKNOWN | Security concerns? |
| Airports | ❓ UNKNOWN | Security zones? |
| Military Bases | ❌ LIKELY BANNED | Obvious security issue |

### Research Questions
1. **How does Pokémon GO handle banned zones?**
2. **What legal liability exists for leading players to dangerous areas?**
3. **Can we use OpenStreetMap data to auto-detect zone types?**
4. **Do we need a user-reporting system for unsafe locations?**

### Private Property Consideration
> "If somebody owns 20 acres and wants to do a Black Bart Gold Easter egg hunt on their property, I want that available to them."

- Allow hiding on private property
- User's responsibility to have permission
- Include in Terms of Service

## 👶 Age Verification

### Current Status: UNCERTAIN

### Requirements
- Initially: No age restrictions
- Future: Age-gated content for sponsor types

| Sponsor Type | Age Requirement |
|--------------|-----------------|
| General | Any age |
| Casino | 21+ (varies by jurisdiction) |
| Alcohol | 21+ (varies by jurisdiction) |
| Tobacco | 21+ |
| Cannabis | 21+ (where legal) |

### Research Questions
1. **How do apps verify age beyond self-reporting?**
2. **Is ID verification legally required for gambling-adjacent content?**
3. **What does Pokémon GO do for age verification?**
4. **COPPA compliance for users under 13?**

### Potential Solutions
- Self-reported age (minimum viable)
- ID scan verification (more secure)
- Credit card requirement (proves 18+)
- Third-party age verification services

## 🛡️ Child Safety

### Current Status: NEEDS RESEARCH

### Concerns
1. **Leading children to dangerous areas**
2. **Strangers knowing where children are**
3. **Predatory behavior potential**

### Research Questions
1. **How does Pokémon GO protect children?**
2. **Does Google Maps have safety data we can use?**
3. **Should children have limited map visibility?**
4. **Parental controls / family accounts?**

### Potential Safeguards
- No coins in isolated/dangerous areas
- Daylight-only play for minors

## 🌊 Water Detection

### Current Decision: NO COINS ON WATER

### Implementation Questions
1. Use GPS + map overlay to detect water?
2. What data source for water boundaries?
3. How accurate does detection need to be?
4. What about boats/ferries?

### Edge Cases
- Coins on bridges over water - allowed?
- Coins on piers/docks - allowed?
- Coins on beaches - allowed?
- Coins on boats - probably not feasible
