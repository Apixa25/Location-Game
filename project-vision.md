## 🌟 Project Essence

**Location-Game** is an **augmented reality treasure hunt mobile app** where players discover virtual coins with real Bitcoin value hidden in real-world locations.

### 🎮 Core Concept

Players use their mobile device as a "viewfinder" to see hidden virtual spinning coins overlaid on the real world through their camera. Each coin has a value that converts 1:1 to Bitcoin, meaning players are hunting for **real monetary value**.

### 💰 Business Model & Gas System

#### ⛽ The Gas System (Core Revenue Model)

Playing the game requires **"gas"** - a daily fee that is consumed and never returned.

| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Base Cost** | $10 USD minimum to start playing |
| **Daily Gas Consumption** | ~$0.33/day (1/30th of $10) |
| **Gas Source** | Initial purchase OR found coins |
| **No Gas = No Play** | Must buy more or use found coins |

**How Gas Works:**
1. User pays $10 → Gets 30 days of gas
2. Each day, ~$0.33 is consumed as gas (our revenue)
3. When gas runs out, user can't play
4. Found coins can be used AS gas to extend playtime
5. Eventually ALL money returns to us as gas fees

#### 💎 Coin Ownership & Purchasing

- Users can **buy any amount of coins** from us at any time
- Coins can be **hidden** (for others to find) OR **kept as gas**
- Users can **re-hide coins they find**
- Base $10 subscription includes NO coins to hide - just gas to play

#### 🔑 The Finding Limit System

This is the core game theory mechanic that drives the economy:

- **Default Limit**: Players can only find coins worth **maximum $1**
- **Unlock Higher Limits**: To find bigger coins, you must HIDE bigger coins
- **Your Limit = Your Highest Hidden Coin Value**

**Example Scenarios:**

| Player | Coins Hidden | Max Find | Strategy Choice |
|--------|--------------|----------|-----------------|
| User A | None | $1 | Finds $5 → Can use as ~15 days gas OR hide to unlock $5 finds |
| User B | $25 (once) | $25 | Invested to unlock bigger potential finds |
| User C | $100 (once) | $100 | High roller - can find up to $100 coins |

#### 🎯 Player Strategy Choices

When a player finds coins, they must choose:
1. **Use as Gas** - Extend playtime (found $5 = ~15 more days of play)
2. **Hide the Coins** - Raise their finding limit to match

This creates a **self-sustaining closed-loop economy** where:
- Players are incentivized to contribute value to find value
- All money eventually returns to us as gas fees
- Players have meaningful choices about how to use their coins

### 🎯 Core Goals

- **Real Value Gaming** - Players hunt for coins with actual Bitcoin value
- **Fair Economy** - 90% return rate ensures players get value for their subscription
- **Community-Driven Treasures** - Users can hide coins for others to find
- **Balanced Progression** - Finding limits tied to contribution prevents exploitation
- **AR Immersion** - Pokémon GO-style augmented reality experience

### 💡 Core Values

- **Transparency** - Clear rules about finding limits and coin values
- **Fairness** - Everyone plays by the same rules
- **Real Value** - No fake currency, actual Bitcoin backing
- **Security** - Protect user funds and personal data
- **Fun First** - Despite real money, it should be exciting and enjoyable

## 💬 Communication Standards

### When Working Together:
1. **Use markdown formatting** - Keep responses well-organized
2. **Give long, clear explanations** - Don't assume I know what you're thinking
3. **Include file paths in all code blocks** - Always show where code lives
4. **Show simplified code snippets** highlighting changes
5. **Use emojis to enhance engagement** and maintain high energy 🎯
6. **Ask before guessing** - If you don't know something, ask me first rather than making assumptions

### What I Value:
- **Additive solutions** - Build on what we have, don't break existing work
- **Preservation** - Don't delete or break existing functionality
- **Context awareness** - Review the codebase before making suggestions
- **Clear explanations** - Help me understand the "why" behind changes

## 🧠 Understanding Me (Enneagram 7)

I'm an **Enneagram Type 7** - The Enthusiast. This means:
- **Possibilities-focused** - I love exploring options and potential
- **Energy-driven** - I respond well to enthusiasm and positive energy
- **Future-oriented** - I think about what could be, not just what is
- **Action-oriented** - I prefer moving forward over over-analyzing

### How This Affects Our Work:
- **Maintain excitement** while building systematically
- **Open to innovative suggestions** that enhance engagement
- **Value both technical excellence AND user enjoyment**

## 🚀 Development Approach

### Key Principles:
1. **Preserve existing work** - Add new features without breaking old ones
2. **Review codebase frequently** - Understand context before suggesting changes
3. **Verify code context** - Look at actual files, not assumptions
4. **Iterative improvements** - Build on what we have, evolve gradually
5. **User experience first** - Technical solutions serve the user experience

### When Making Changes:
- **Start with understanding** - Review related files first
- **Propose additive solutions** - Work alongside existing code
- **Explain the approach** - Help me understand your thinking
- **Consider security implications** - We're handling real money!
- **Test thoroughly** - Real Bitcoin means real consequences for bugs

## 🛡️ Safety Net & Industry Standards

### Critical: Verify Against Best Practices
I'm learning as we go, and I'm trusting you to be my safety net. **Don't just trust my approach - verify it against industry standards.**

**What this means:**
- **Question non-standard setups** - If something looks unusual, flag it and check the standard approach
- **Verify against official docs** - When working with AR frameworks, Bitcoin/crypto APIs, etc., cross-reference with official documentation
- **Catch configuration issues early** - Look for common pitfalls
- **Suggest industry-standard patterns** - Thousands of developers have solved these problems; use their solutions
- **Explain why** - When you suggest a change, explain the industry-standard approach and why it's better

**My role:** I'm learning and exploring. **Your role:** Be the experienced developer who catches things I might miss and guides us toward proven solutions.

- ✅ ViroReact actively maintained (ReactVision/Morrow, 2025)
- ✅ Supports 3D models (.gltf/.obj) with animations
- ✅ ARKit (iOS) + ARCore (Android) support
- ✅ Good enough for our "Prize Finder" spinning coins
- ✅ Can pivot to Unity later if we need more advanced AR

---

## 🔧 Key Technical Considerations

### AR Implementation ("Prize Finder")
- Camera-based viewfinder showing virtual coins in real-world space
- ViroARScene for camera background
- Viro3DObject for spinning coin models
- ViroAnimations for spin/glow effects
- GPS for location tracking and coin placement

### Financial System
- Bitcoin integration for real-value coins
- Secure wallet management
- Subscription payment processing ($10/month minimum)
- Gas system (daily consumption)
- Transaction history and audit trails

### Location System
- **Configurable radiuses** (initial defaults, can be adjusted):
  - ~¼ mile radius for system-placed coins (walkable for kids)
  - ~10 mile radius for user-hidden coins
- Accurate GPS positioning (ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION)
- Geofencing for coin discovery
- Kid-friendly design: walkable distances so players don't need to drive

### Security (Critical!)
- This involves real money - security is paramount
- Prevent cheating/spoofing GPS locations
- Secure all financial transactions
- Protect user account data
- Prevent coin duplication or manipulation
